# Intellij Idea High-Contrast theme builder

#### Description:

This repository contains my themes for Intellij Idea, made for the version 2024.3, old UI style.

Second, there is the SunLike theme which uses a custom-made framework - the "*" global colors in theme.json, and a python .xml parser to parse {color_name} into predefined hexes.
